# OpenCode Beta

This is the **beta channel** for the OpenCode add-on. It contains experimental features and fixes that are being validated before inclusion in the stable release.

**You can install this alongside the stable OpenCode add-on.** Both will appear in the sidebar (as "OpenCode" and "OpenCode Beta") and operate independently.

## Current Beta Changes

- **OpenChamber interface mode**: New experimental `openchamber` interface mode starts the OpenChamber web UI behind Home Assistant Ingress, while the default `terminal` mode keeps the existing ttyd terminal unchanged.
- **Serial device access**: Selected host UART/serial devices can be mapped into the add-on for USB flashing and adapter inspection workflows. Full Supervisor `uart` and `udev` manifest flags remain disabled by default because they are static permissions, not runtime user options.
- **Optional LAN server mode**: You can now enable an OpenCode server bound to `0.0.0.0` so other computers on your local network can connect directly.
- **PPQ private TEE models**: Opt-in encrypted proxy for PPQ private models running in remote TEEs. The proxy is internal-only and binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the add-on container.
- **Web terminal clipboard fixes**: Copying inside OpenCode now reaches the browser clipboard, plain `Ctrl+V` paste works, and macOS users can use `Option+drag` to select text while full-screen terminal apps capture the mouse.
- **Touch scrolling**: One-finger vertical drag gestures inside the terminal now scroll full-screen apps such as OpenCode on phones and tablets.
- **OpenCode update policy**: The add-on can keep OpenCode updated in persistent add-on data (`latest`) or use only the image-bundled version (`bundled`).

## Add-on Folder Access

OpenCode mounts `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for Home Assistant add-on development access. Enable **Add-on Folder Guidance** in the add-on configuration and restart to show these paths in the terminal. This option updates guidance, but the mounts are static add-on metadata and are not a hard filesystem permission boundary.

Treat `/addon_configs` as sensitive because it may contain configuration data for other add-ons.

## Resource Usage

OpenCode snapshots are disabled by default in this add-on to reduce memory and disk pressure on Home Assistant systems. File watching also ignores noisy internal paths such as `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, caches, logs, and the Home Assistant database. You can override these defaults with **Custom OpenCode Configuration (JSON)** if you need OpenCode's built-in snapshot/undo behavior.

## OpenCode Updates

By default, **OpenCode Update Policy** is set to `latest`. The add-on installs or updates OpenCode in `/data/.npm-global` and uses that persistent install before the image-bundled fallback. Set the policy to `bundled` to use only the OpenCode version included in the add-on image and disable OpenCode self-update.

For x64 VM installs, make sure the guest can see AVX2 when the host supports it. Generic QEMU/KVM CPU models can hide AVX2 and force OpenCode's baseline binary.

## Interface Mode (Beta)

The beta add-on can show either the existing terminal interface or the experimental OpenChamber web UI in the Home Assistant sidebar.

Modes:

- `terminal`: default. Uses the existing ttyd terminal and tmux session.
- `openchamber`: starts OpenChamber behind Home Assistant Ingress on the same sidebar entry.

To test OpenChamber:

1. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, set **Interface Mode** to `openchamber`.
2. Save and restart the add-on.
3. Open **OpenCode Beta** from the Home Assistant sidebar.

Security and networking notes:

- OpenChamber is not exposed through a Home Assistant Network port by default.
- The OpenChamber process binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the container.
- A small first-party ingress proxy binds to internal port `8099`, accepts Home Assistant Ingress traffic, and forwards to OpenChamber locally.
- Home Assistant Ingress provides the browser authentication layer, so no separate OpenChamber UI password is configured for this mode.
- LAN access remains the separate opt-in **OpenCode LAN Server** feature on port `4096`.

Known beta risk: OpenChamber is a root-hosted web app, so this beta includes a pinned bundle patch for Home Assistant's `/api/hassio_ingress/...` path. If the page loads but actions fail, switch **Interface Mode** back to `terminal`, restart the add-on, and include logs when reporting the issue.

## Zigbee2MQTT URL

If you configure `z2m_url` for zigporter commands, use a full URL such as `http://homeassistant.local:8099`. Host/IP-only values are accepted and treated as `http://`.

## LAN Server Mode (Beta)

LAN server mode lets you attach to the Home Assistant-hosted OpenCode session from a terminal outside the Home Assistant UI.

To enable LAN access:

1. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, set **Enable OpenCode LAN Server** to `true`.
2. In the add-on **Network** settings, map `4096/tcp` to the host port you want to use.
3. Save and restart the add-on.

On the secondary computer, use `opencode attach` with your Home Assistant host IP and configured port:

```bash
opencode attach http://<home-assistant-ip>:<mapped-host-port>
```

Example, if you mapped `4096/tcp` to host port `4096`:

```bash
opencode attach http://192.168.1.50:4096
```

The add-on log shows the current Home Assistant port mapping when the server starts, for example `Home Assistant port mapping: 4096/tcp -> 3443`. If OpenCode also prints `opencode server listening on http://0.0.0.0:4096`, that is the internal container listener, not the URL to use from another computer. Use your Home Assistant host and the mapped host port instead.

Security warning: enabling this service and mapping the port exposes an OpenCode server on your LAN. Only use this on trusted networks, restrict access with your network/firewall controls, and never expose the port to the internet or untrusted networks.

## OpenChamber Web Interface (Beta)

OpenChamber is a web interface for OpenCode. It turns the terminal-based coding assistant into a visual workspace featuring chat timelines, file diff viewers, multi-model execution, and session state sync.

To enable OpenChamber:

1. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, set **Enable OpenChamber Interface** to `true`.
2. Set **OpenChamber Password** to a strong password.
3. Configure **OpenChamber Port** (default `3010`) if you want to run it on a non-default port.
4. In the add-on **Network** settings, map the configured port (e.g. `3010/tcp`) to your host.
5. Save and restart the add-on.

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://<home-assistant-ip>:<mapped-host-port>
```

Like the OpenCode LAN server, only enable and map this port on trusted local networks and never expose it directly to the internet without proper authentication/firewall controls.

OpenChamber is pinned to a specific version at image build time to keep add-on metadata and runtime package contents in sync.

## PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)

PPQ private mode routes OpenCode requests through a local encryption proxy before forwarding them to PPQ's private inference API. The proxy verifies the remote enclave, encrypts the request locally, and decrypts the response locally.

To enable PPQ private models:

1. Get a PPQ API key from PPQ.
2. In the add-on **Configuration** tab, set **Enable PPQ Private TEE Models** to `true`.
3. Paste the key into **PPQ API Key**. Alternatively, set `PPQ_API_KEY` through **Environment Variables** if you manage credentials that way.
4. Save and restart the add-on.
5. In OpenCode, select the `PPQ Private (TEE)` provider and one of the `private/...` models.

Security notes:

- The proxy binds only to `127.0.0.1:8787` inside the add-on container.
- No Home Assistant network port is exposed for PPQ private mode.
- The PPQ API key is not logged.
- The proxy package is pinned at image build time; the add-on does not run `npx latest` at startup.

Bundled model IDs come from the pinned `ppq-private-mode` package version: `private/kimi-k2-5`, `private/deepseek-r1-0528`, `private/gpt-oss-120b`, `private/llama3-3-70b`, and `private/qwen3-vl-30b`.
